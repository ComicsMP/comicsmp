This is meant if I notice that a certain series is missing issues or variants from a scrap not complete
Running this will get it all updated.
Just need to enter urls of the series (with grid page .. meaning main series page with all the issues for this series and also see the tabs too ) 

We ahve two scripts 

Scrape_Series_Fresh_When_Small is for small less than 100 issues. it will simply scan everything and our other scrips will insert what is needed in step 2 and step 3

Scrape_Series_Looking_For_Missing_Only_Large.py is for large comic series like over 150 issues and more so it doesn't crawl everything it will look at our DB for missing issues and focus on those.
